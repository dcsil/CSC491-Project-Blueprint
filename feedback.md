# 💬 Feedback & Continuous Improvement

### Something feels off? Say something.

Courses—like modern software products—benefit from constant iteration. If a component of this blueprint feels outdated, unclear, or inefficient—or if you have ideas to add genuine value—please share them. This curriculum is designed to evolve, and thoughtful feedback, constructive critique, and well-reasoned suggestions are encouraged. We are all here to learn, and that includes the teaching team.

## 📢 Where to share your thoughts

To provide feedback or ask questions, please use the communication channels outlined in the course policy on **Quercus**:

* **Public/General:** Use the course discussion spaces (Quercus / Slack) for suggestions that benefit the entire cohort.
* **Private:** Use email or speak with us in-person during office hours for personal or sensitive matters.

> [!CAUTION]
> **Do not use GitHub Issues in this repository for feedback or questions.** The Issues here serve as a sample blueprint linked to the project board. Opening new issues or commenting on existing ones will disrupt the board visualization and may confuse your peers. We must keep this repository environment isolated.

## ⚖️ How feedback is used
Please keep in mind that not every suggestion will be implemented exactly as proposed. As the instructor, I retain final responsibility for course decisions; however, your constructive input is a vital part of the data used to improve those decisions.
